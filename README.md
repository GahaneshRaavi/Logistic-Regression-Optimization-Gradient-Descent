# Logistic-Regression-Optimization-Gradient-Descent
A machine learning fundamentals project analyzing gradient descent optimization for logistic regression. The project compares batch and mini-batch gradient descent under different learning rates and batch sizes, examining convergence behavior, stability, and performance using a single-neuron model implemented from scratch.
